# BUTTONS
For buttons, you must use the `btn` class, followed by the type and/or style of button you want. MonsterCSS offers two: background-filled and outlined only.

## BACKGROUND FILLED
There are six options of background-filled buttons. The color of the label is white and the background changes according to the classes defined bellow:

- `btn-primary`
- `btn-success`
- `btn-info`
- `btn-warning`
- `btn-danger`
- `btn-secondary`
- `btn-dark`
- `btn-white`
- `btn-black`

To see what the colors for `primary`, `success`, and other variants are, please refer to the `colors.md` file.

## OUTLINED ONLY
You can also use buttons without a background, that is, with a border and a colored label. Here are the options:

- `btn-outline-primary`
- `btn-outline-success`
- `btn-outline-info`
- `btn-outline-warning`
- `btn-outline-danger`
- `btn-outline-secondary`
- `btn-outline-dark`
- `btn-outline-white`
- `btn-outline-black`
