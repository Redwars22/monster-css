# CONTAINERS

MonsterCSS has two types of containers: flex and grid.

# GRID

You can use the `grid` class in order to turn a `div` into a grid container. Then you can define the sizes of columns by using `col-1`, for example. The sizes go from 1 to 6.

# FLEX
As for flexbox, you can create flex containers by using the `flex` class. You can define the sizes of columns by using `flex-col-1`, for example. The sizes also go from 1 to 6. Both grid and flex containers are responsive in MonsterCSS.

You also have the following classes:

For justifying items:

- `just-start`
- `just-center`
- `just-end`
- `just-around`
- `just-between`

For aligning items:

- `ai-start`
- `ai-center`
- `ai-end`
- `ai-stretch`

For flex-direction:

- `flex-row`
- `flex-row-reverse`
- `flex-column`
- `flex-column-reverse`
