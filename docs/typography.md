# TYPOGRAPHY

By default, MonsterCSS uses 16px for regular text, 1.5 for the line height and `#333333` for the foreground color. And the default font is Nunito, which is readable and smooth.

## TITLES

For titles h1 to h6, the font-sizes are the following:

| Level | Size |
|--- |--- |
| h1 | 2.5rem |
| h2 | 2rem |
| h3 | 1.75rem |
| h4 | 1.5rem |
| h5 | 1.25rem |
| h6 | 1rem |

## PARAGRAPHS

For paragraphs, there's bottom margin of 1.5rem. As for links, the default color is `#0056b3` and there's an underline decoration on hower.

For screens smaller than 768px, the font sizes adapt and may have different values than those above. Things might be tweaked in future releases of MonsterCSS. If you ever find any bug, feel free to report it.
