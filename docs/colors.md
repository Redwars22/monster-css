# COLORS

Here's a table with the default colors used for all elements:

| Label | HEX Code |
|--- |--- |
| primary | #007bff |
| secondary | #6c757d |
| info | #17a2b8 |
| danger | #dc3545 |
| warning | #ffc107 |
| success | #28a745 |

You can also add a background color to any element by using `bg-primary`, for example, and add a foreground with `text-primary`. It should work the same way for the other colors.
